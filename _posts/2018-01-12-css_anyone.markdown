Wow! I thought I was understanding CSS and HTML and was really enjoying the coding. Then I work on the ZHW Shoes lesson and  I realize I missed a basic concept. So of course, the code basically works, but there is this one little piece that won't fit right. I work on it all day long and finally "Ask a Question".

Who knew that you could have more than one .class in the same line of HTML? Apparently, everyone but me! But, it was really great working with the instructors who straightened me out and once I understood the grid concept, I had it done (make that re-done!) in short order...

I love learning! Sometimes I wish I was better at "asking a question" a little sooner rather than banging my head against the wall so many times first; but, I am loving it even more now. On to the next adventure!
