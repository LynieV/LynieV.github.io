This section held some difficult concepts for me. Understanding how each piece works together to create the complete project was especially interesting.

For this project I decided to put together an app I will be able to use in my current practice as a massage therapist. I created the app for my personal use, but it can be used by more than one therapist. 

The most difficult concept for me was understanding how the concept of CRUD actions within the controllers worked to make the app flow smoothly. Understanding which "get" or "post" requests to use and the order that they are used in, as well as where to use "erb" vs. "redirect."

I enjoyed having the guidelines to meet the project requirements and I look forward to learning more so I can apply future knowledge to improve upon the app as I move forward in the program. I think overall the project went well for me, but I still have much to learn to make the app more polished.
