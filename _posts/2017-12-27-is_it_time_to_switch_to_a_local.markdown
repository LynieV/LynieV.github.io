The Git lessons have been the most confusing to me so far. I'm still using the Learn IDE and it has been working for me wonderfully until recently. I started the Git lessons and talked with several people because I was unsure if I should switch to local or continue with the Learn IDE. I talked it over with students and instructors, and it really does seem to be a personal preference at this point in the curriculum.

Instructors recommend you do the switch around when you start your first project. Which makes sense to me since that would be when you start moving toward working more independently. Students are split down the middle, some are where I'm at in the program and already in a local IDE and others are far beyond the first project and still in the Learn IDE. I decided to continue using the Learn IDE.

Then I got to the HTML5 Video Embed Codealong. I imported one video and then tried to import the second and the Learn IDE kept disconnecting... I spent two days trying to figure out what I was doing wrong, had the internet checked, shut down the program, re-installed the Learn IDE. Finally, one of the instructors helped me change to a different Learn IDE and I'm moving forward again.

Maybe it is time to try a local?!?
