I was feeling like I was moving along pretty good, I started reaching out to a few people who seemed to be cruising at the same pace as me. I felt like I was getting it and really enjoying the learning process. Then the computer has a bit of a meltdown. I get it squared away, mostly. Hit a couple of hiccups but they get smoothed out pretty quickly.

So, it takes me a few days to get back on track and keep the flow going. So many helpful people out there and everyone wants to help you learn, so cool... I get started again and moving along, come across the most complicated coding that I have done so far (which at this point isn't much, but you have to start somewhere!). Needed to ask for help a couple of times, but I was really getting it.

Then, went of town for several days, some business, some pleasure. It was GREAT to take some planned time off, but now it is like re-learning it all over again. Very frustrating that I can't just pick back up, have to take a couple days to review... Still loving it! But I have learned that to keep a foot in the door, even only an hour a day, will be very helpful for me in the future! :)
